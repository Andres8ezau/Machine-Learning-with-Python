# Part 7 Artificial Neural Networks 
Originally hypothesised in the 1940s, So called *Neural networks* by his similarity with the human brain are now one of the main tools used in modern AI.
Neural networks can be used for both regression and categorisation applications using layers with variable inputs and outputs.

Recent advances with storage, processing power, and open-source tools have allowed many successful applications of neural networks in medical diagnosis,
filtering explicit content, speech recognition and machine translation.
