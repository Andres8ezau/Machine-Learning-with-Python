# Part 7 Artificial Neural Networks 
Originally hypothesised between the 1940s and 1950 by **Frank Rosenblatt**, So called *Neural networks* by his similarity with the human brain are now one of the main tools used in deep learning of modern AI.
Neural networks can be used for both regression and categorisation applications using layers with variable inputs and outputs.

Recent advances with storage, processing power, and open-source tools have allowed many successful applications of neural networks in medical diagnosis,
filtering explicit content, speech recognition and machine translation.

Lets suposse that we have 7 neurons with the folliwing configuration:

  - We have 2 neurons as inputs. 
  - Each of the 2 neurons is connected with the following 4 neurons. 
  - Lastly, respectively all 4 neurons are conected to the output neuron.

The previous neurons configuration it's arranged in the form of a network that could take complex and abstract decissions
broadly, this a manner to condense an *Artificial Neural Network* compose by neurons previously deffined ith layers and where outputs can act as inputs and vice versa.
