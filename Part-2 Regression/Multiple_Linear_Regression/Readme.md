# Multiple Linear Regression

Multiple linear regression is used to estimate the relationship between **two or more** independent variables and **one** dependent variable.  

## The math

The equation for Multiple Linear Regression is similar to the simple linear regression but with the key difference that there is more than one independent variable.

Consider the given simple dataset which consists of data of 50 startups. The profit is dependent on the 4 independent variables R&D spend, Adminstartion, Marketing & State.  
(Note that out of the 4, State is a categorical variable while the others are numerical)  
Hence, Multiple linear regression can be applied to predict the profit given the values of the 4 variables.  

Since the equation involves more than 2 variables, it is not possible to visualize the result in a 2 dimensional plot (as in the case of Simple linear regression).
