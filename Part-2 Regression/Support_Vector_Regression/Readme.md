# Support Vector Regression

Unlike the previous regression where we plot a line or curve, In SVR, we identify a hyperplane with maximum margin such that the maximum number of data points are within that margin.  
SVRs are almost similar to the SVM (Refer classification algorithms).  

Instead of minimizing the error as in simple linear regression, we try to fit the error within a certain range. Hence we consider the points that are within this margin.
