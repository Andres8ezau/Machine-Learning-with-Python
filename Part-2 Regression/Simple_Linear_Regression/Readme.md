# Simple Linear Regression

Simple linear regression is used to estimate the relationship between **two** quantitative variables. One value is for the dependent variable and one value is for the independent variable.  

## The math 
Linear regression is nothing but a manifestation of the simple line equation  
*y = mx + c*  

The same equation of a line can be re-written as:

Consider the given Dataset containing "years-of-experience" and corresponding "salary". Clearly, there is a correlation that as years of experience increases, salary also increases.  
Hence it is possible to predict a person's salary based on years of experience using Simple Linear Regression.  
Here, x = years of experience, y = salary and b & b0 are the coeffiecients of the equation. So in order to predict y (salary) given x (years-of-experience), we need to know the values of b and b0 (the modelâ€™s coefficients).  

*While training and building a regression model, it is these coefficients which are learned and fitted to training data.*
