# Random Forest Regression

Random Forest Regression is a supervised learning algorithm that uses ensemble learning method for regression. (Ensemble learning method is a technique that combines predictions from multiple machine learning algorithms to make a more accurate prediction than a single model.)

Random forest Regression overcomes the common problem of overfitting in Decision Trees.  
The basic idea is to combine multiple decision trees in determining the final output rather than relying on individual decision trees.
