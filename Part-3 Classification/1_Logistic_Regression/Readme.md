# Logistic Regression

 Logistic Regression is used when the dependent variable is categorical. For example,
 * To predict whether a tumor is malignant (1) or not (0)  
 * To predict whether an email is spam (1) or not (0)
 
 ## The Logistic function
 
 The logistic function, also called as the **sigmoid function**, is an S-shaped curve that can take any real-valued number and map it into a value between 0 and 1, but never exactly at those limits.
